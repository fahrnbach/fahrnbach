# 👋 Hi, I’m Jacob Fahrnbach

🎯 **Self-taught full-stack developer** with 4,800+ hours of hands-on experience building applications with JavaScript, Angular, Node.js, Docker, and AWS. I love combining code with creative design, and I’m passionate about building tools that improve lives.

💻 I’ve also spent 3,700+ hours creating digital art, UI design, and animations using tools like Photoshop, After Effects, Illustrator, and Blender. My goal is to fuse technical power with aesthetic clarity.

🌱 Currently exploring:
- 🧠 Clean UI architecture in Angular
- 🧰 Scaling projects with Docker & CI/CD
- 🐍 Practical Python scripting
- 📱 Building Swift-based iOS prototypes
